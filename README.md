# ‚ô†Ô∏è cordevoir ‚ô†Ô∏è

A fully-featured eCommerce application built with React + Redux toolkit, Strapi as a backend and content management system (CMS), and integration of the Stripe API for order and payment management.

Front-end is currently deployed. It's near impossible to deploy Strapi on a free server, but I will continue trying. See [Demo](#demo) to quickly see the site in full or [Setup](#-setup-) if you want to locally host the backend and view the website yourself.

Want to test the Stripe payment feature? [Use these cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).

> [!NOTE]
> You must input a properly formatted email during Step 2 of checkout to be taken to the Stripe payment page.

# Setup üìù

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:siudn/cordevoir.git
cd cordevoir
```

### 2. **.env Setup**

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Look for ".env.example" in the /server folder and change the name to just ".env". Then replace everything with the code below:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS="`openssl rand -base64 32`,`openssl rand -base64 32`"
API_TOKEN_SALT=`openssl rand -base64 32`
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=`openssl rand -base64 32`
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT=`openssl rand -base64 32`
JWT_SECRET=`openssl rand -base64 32`
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=pasteYoursHere
```

### 3. **Retrieve Stripe Secret Key**

To actually use the Stripe functionality, you will need to paste your own Stripe Secret Key into .env: to get one, register [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register), then copy your key at this [link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

Paste your key into where it says `pasteYoursHere` on the .env file from Step 2.

### 4. **Host Backend:**

```bash
cd server #go to the server directory
npm run build
npm start
```

Then, simply visit the website's [link](https://cordevoir.vercel.app/) and all content will be displayed! The website is designed to work off of your locally hosted backend.

## Going Forward

Will definitely add more features, like account creation and validation, memory stored on the server, search, an actual hosted backend, cooler animations, etc.

This project was tough and I spent way too much time trying to get that backend online, but it was an amazing learning experience.
